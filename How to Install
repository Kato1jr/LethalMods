Sooo you wanna play lethal company ay?!

First you will need to install BepinEx which deals with all the mods 
The easiest way to do this is to install Vortex

Installing Vortex:
  -Head to https://www.nexusmods.com/
  -Create an account (its free)
  -Goto this page https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1 and click the "manual" button on the left hand side
  -Once Vortex is installed open it and login using your nexus mods account
  -Click the green select a game to manage and seach for lethal company (theres a search bar at the top)
  -It will tell you it needs to download BepinEx and may need to restart vortex, this is fine and correct
  -After it has installed you can go to the mods section of vortex to check that BepinEx is installed
  -Once confimed close Vortex, you will no longer need it

Congrats! you now have BepinEx the base mod.

Next you need to download the plugins file that has all the mods and suits 
It can be found on the main page of the github.
Download and extract the plugins folder inside the rar
DO NOT JUST PLACE THE RAR IN THE LETHAL COMPANY FOLDER THIS WILL NOT WORK

After downloading the plugins file you will need to locate where your lethal company is installed.
The easiest way to do this:
  -Open Steam
  -Right click lethal company and click on properties
  -Goto installed files and click the browse button on the right hand side
  -Head into the BepinEX folder and replace the plugins folder with the one downloaded from google drive

You should now be done! and able to play the games with the mods and suits we currently have installed!
When you launch Lethal company a CMD window should now also lauch along side it, this is fine and Shows that your mods are installed correctly
